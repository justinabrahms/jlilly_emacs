;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides remote file editing, similar to ange-ftp.
;; The difference is that ange-ftp uses FTP to transfer files between
;; the local and the remote host, whereas tramp.el uses a combination
;; of rsh and rcp or other work-alike programs, such as ssh/scp.
;;
;; For more detailed instructions, please see the info file.
;;
;; Notes:
;; -----
;;
;; This package only works for Emacs 21.1 and higher, and for XEmacs 21.4
;; and higher.  For XEmacs 21, you need the package `fsf-compat' for
;; the `with-timeout' macro.)
;;
;; This version might not work with pre-Emacs 21 VC unless VC is
;; loaded before tramp.el.  Could you please test this and tell me about
;; the result?  Thanks.
;;
;; Also see the todo list at the bottom of this file.
;;
;; The current version of Tramp can be retrieved from the following URL:
;;            http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/tramp/
;;
;; There's a mailing list for this, as well.  Its name is:
;;            tramp-devel@gnu.org
;; You can use the Web to subscribe, under the following URL:
;;            http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/tramp-devel
;;
;; For the adventurous, the current development sources are available
;; via CVS.  You can find instructions about this at the following URL:
;;            http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/tramp/

  "*Alist of methods for remote files.
This is a list of entries of the form (NAME PARAM1 PARAM2 ...).
Each NAME stands for a remote access method.  Each PARAM is a
pair of the form (KEY VALUE).  The following KEYs are defined:
  * `tramp-remote-sh'
    This specifies the Bourne shell to use on the remote host.  This
    MUST be a Bourne-like shell.  It is normally not necessary to set
    this to any value other than \"/bin/sh\": Tramp wants to use a shell
    which groks tilde expansion, but it can search for it.  Also note
    that \"/bin/sh\" exists on all Unixen, this might not be true for
    the value that you decide to use.  You Have Been Warned.
  * `tramp-login-program'
    This specifies the name of the program to use for logging in to the
    remote host.  This may be the name of rsh or a workalike program,
    or the name of telnet or a workalike, or the name of su or a workalike.
  * `tramp-login-args'
    This specifies the list of arguments to pass to the above
    mentioned program.  Please note that this is a list of list of arguments,
    that is, normally you don't want to put \"-a -b\" or \"-f foo\"
    here.  Instead, you want a list (\"-a\" \"-b\"), or (\"-f\" \"foo\").
    There are some patterns: \"%h\" in this list is replaced by the host
    name, \"%u\" is replaced by the user name, \"%p\" is replaced by the
    port number, and \"%%\" can be used to obtain a literal percent character.
    If a list containing \"%h\", \"%u\" or \"%p\" is unchanged during
    expansion (i.e. no host or no user specified), this list is not used as
    argument.  By this, arguments like (\"-l\" \"%u\") are optional.
    \"%t\" is replaced by the temporary file name produced with
    `tramp-make-tramp-temp-file'.  \"%k\" indicates the keep-date
    parameter of a program, if exists.
  * `tramp-copy-program'
    This specifies the name of the program to use for remotely copying
    the file; this might be the absolute filename of rcp or the name of
    a workalike program.
  * `tramp-copy-args'
    This specifies the list of parameters to pass to the above mentioned
    program, the hints for `tramp-login-args' also apply here.
  * `tramp-copy-keep-date'
    This specifies whether the copying program when the preserves the
    timestamp of the original file.
  * `tramp-default-port'
    The default port of a method is needed in case of gateway connections.
    Additionally, it is used as indication which method is prepared for
    passing gateways.
  * `tramp-gw-args'
    As the attribute name says, additional arguments are specified here
    when a method is applied via a gateway.
  * `tramp-password-end-of-line'
    This specifies the string to use for terminating the line after
    submitting the password.  If this method parameter is nil, then the
    value of the normal variable `tramp-default-password-end-of-line'
    is used.  This parameter is necessary because the \"plink\" program
    requires any two characters after sending the password.  These do
    not have to be newline or carriage return characters.  Other login
    programs are happy with just one character, the newline character.
    We use \"xy\" as the value for methods using \"plink\".

What does all this mean?  Well, you should specify `tramp-login-program'
for all methods; this program is used to log in to the remote site.  Then,
there are two ways to actually transfer the files between the local and the
remote side.  One way is using an additional rcp-like program.  If you want
to do this, set `tramp-copy-program' in the method.

Another possibility for file transfer is inline transfer, i.e. the
file is passed through the same buffer used by `tramp-login-program'.  In
this case, the file contents need to be protected since the
`tramp-login-program' might use escape codes or the connection might not
be eight-bit clean.  Therefore, file contents are encoded for transit.
See the variables `tramp-local-coding-commands' and
`tramp-remote-coding-commands' for details.

So, to summarize: if the method is an out-of-band method, then you
must specify `tramp-copy-program' and `tramp-copy-args'.  If it is an
inline method, then these two parameters should be nil.  Methods which
are fit for gateways must have `tramp-default-port' at least.

Notes:

When using `su' or `sudo' the phrase `open connection to a remote
host' sounds strange, but it is used nevertheless, for consistency.
No connection is opened to a remote host, but `su' or `sudo' is
started on the local host.  You should specify a remote host
`localhost' or the name of the local host.  Another host name is
useful only in combination with `tramp-default-proxies-alist'.")

It is necessary only on systems which have a buggy `process-send-string'

        (let ((proc (start-process (buffer-name) (current-buffer)
                                   \"ssh\" \"-l\" user host \"wc\" \"-c\")))

            (process-send-string proc (make-string sent ?\\ ))

            (process-send-eof proc))
          (while (not (progn (goto-char (point-min))

        (message \"Test does not work\")
        (display-buffer (current-buffer))
        (sit-for 30))))

In the Emacs normally running Tramp, evaluate the above code
\(replace \"xxx\" and \"yyy\" by the remote user and host name,
respectively).  You can do this, for example, by pasting it into
the `*scratch*' buffer and then hitting C-j with the cursor after the
last closing parenthesis.  Note that it works only if you have configured
\"ssh\" to run without password query, see ssh-agent(1).

You will see the number of bytes sent successfully to the remote host.
If that number exceeds 1000, you can stop the execution by hitting
C-g, because your Emacs is likely clean.

When it is necessary to set `tramp-chunksize', you might consider to
use an out-of-the-band method (like \"scp\") instead of an internal one
\(like \"ssh\"), because setting `tramp-chunksize' to non-nil decreases
performance.

If your Emacs is buggy, the code stops and gives you an indication
about the value `tramp-chunksize' should be set.  Maybe you could just
experiment a bit, e.g. changing the values of `init' and `step'
in the third line of the code.

Please raise a bug report via \"M-x tramp-bug\" if your system needs
this variable to be set as well."

;; Currently (as of Emacs 20.5), the function `shell-quote-argument'
;; does not deal well with newline characters.  Newline is replaced by
;; backslash newline.  But if, say, the string `a backslash newline b'
;; is passed to a shell, the shell will expand this into "ab",
;; completely omitting the newline.  This is not what was intended.
;; It does not appear to be possible to make the function
;; `shell-quote-argument' work with newlines without making it
;; dependent on the shell used.  But within this package, we know that
;; we will always use a Bourne-like shell, so we use an approach which
;; groks newlines.
;;
;; The approach is simple: we call `shell-quote-argument', then
;; massage the newline part of the result.
;;
;; This function should produce a string which is grokked by a Unix
;; shell, even if the Emacs is running on Windows.  Since this is the
;; kludges section, we bind `system-type' in such a way that
;; `shell-quote-arguments'  behaves as if on Unix.

;; * Rewrite `tramp-shell-quote-argument' to abstain from using
;;   `shell-quote-argument'.
;; * In Emacs 21, `insert-directory' shows total number of bytes used
;;   by the files in that directory.  Add this here.
;; * Avoid screen blanking when hitting `g' in dired.  (Eli Tziperman)
;; * Make ffap.el grok Tramp filenames.  (Eli Tziperman)
;; * When logging in, keep looking for questions according to an alist
;;   and then invoke the right function.
;; * Case-insensitive filename completion.  (Norbert Goevert.)
;; * Don't use globbing for directories with many files, as this is
;;   likely to produce long command lines, and some shells choke on
;;   long command lines.
;; * `vc-directory' does not work.  It never displays any files, even
;;   if it does show files when run locally.
;; * Allow correction of passwords, if the remote end allows this.
;;   (Mark Hershberger)
;; * How to deal with MULE in `insert-file-contents' and `write-region'?
;; * Grok `append' parameter for `write-region'.
;; * Test remote ksh or bash for tilde expansion in `tramp-find-shell'?
;; * abbreviate-file-name
;; * better error checking.  At least whenever we see something
;;   strange when doing zerop, we should kill the process and start
;;   again.  (Greg Stark)
;; * Provide a local cache of old versions of remote files for the rsync
;;   transfer method to use.  (Greg Stark)
;; * Remove unneeded parameters from methods.
;; * Invoke rsync once for copying a whole directory hierarchy.
;;   (Francesco Potort√¨)
;; * Make it work for different encodings, and for different file name
;;   encodings, too.  (Daniel Pittman)
;; * Progress reports while copying files.  (Michael Kifer)
;; * Don't search for perl5 and perl.  Instead, only search for perl and
;;   then look if it's the right version (with `perl -v').
;; * When editing a remote CVS controlled file as a different user, VC
;;   gets confused about the file locking status.  Try to find out why
;;   the workaround doesn't work.
;; * Username and hostname completion.
;; ** Try to avoid usage of `last-input-event' in `tramp-completion-mode-p'.
;; ** Unify `tramp-parse-{rhosts,shosts,sconfig,hosts,passwd,netrc}'.
;;    Code is nearly identical.
;; * Allow out-of-band methods as _last_ multi-hop.  Open a connection
;;   until the last but one hop via `start-file-process'.  Apply it
;;   also for ftp and smb.
;; * WIBNI if we had a command "trampclient"?  If I was editing in
;;   some shell with root priviledges, it would be nice if I could
;;   just call
;;     trampclient filename.c
;;   as an editor, and the _current_ shell would connect to an Emacs
;;   server and would be used in an existing non-priviledged Emacs
;;   session for doing the editing in question.
;;   That way, I need not tell Emacs my password again and be afraid
;;   that it makes it into core dumps or other ugly stuff (I had Emacs
;;   once display a just typed password in the context of a keyboard
;;   sequence prompt for a question immediately following in a shell
;;   script run within Emacs -- nasty).
;;   And if I have some ssh session running to a different computer,
;;   having the possibility of passing a local file there to a local
;;   Emacs session (in case I can arrange for a connection back) would
;;   be nice.
;;   Likely the corresponding Tramp server should not allow the
;;   equivalent of the emacsclient -eval option in order to make this
;;   reasonably unproblematic.  And maybe trampclient should have some
;;   way of passing credentials, like by using an SSL socket or
;;   something. (David Kastrup)
;; * Could Tramp reasonably look for a prompt after ^M rather than
;;   only after ^J ? (Stefan Monnier)
;; * Reconnect directly to a compliant shell without first going
;;   through the user's default shell. (Pete Forman)
;; * Make `tramp-default-user' obsolete.
;; * Tramp shall reconnect automatically to its ssh connection when it
;;   detects that the process "has died". (David Reitter)
;; * How can I interrupt the remote process with a signal
;;   (interrupt-process seems not to work)? (Markus Triska)
;; * Avoid the local shell entirely for starting remote processes.  If
;;   so, I think even a signal, when delivered directly to the local
;;   SSH instance, would correctly be propagated to the remote process
;;   automatically; possibly SSH would have to be started with
;;   "-t". (Markus Triska)
