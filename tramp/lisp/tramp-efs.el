;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides glue between Tramp and EFS.  EFS is hooked into
;; Tramp as a foreign method.  Most of this file has been snarfed from
;; tramp-ftp.el, which does the same for Tramp and Ange-FTP.

;;; Code:

(require 'tramp)

(defvar tramp-efs-method "ftp"
  "Name of the method invoking EFS.")

;; The EFS name format is somewhat restricted.  EFS assumes that the
;; first pair of parentheses is the user and the second is the host.
;; It assumes that there is one character after the host name, and
;; then the localname part follows.  See function `efs-ftp-path' for
;; the code.  If the first pair of parentheses doesn't match anything,
;; then it assumes that the user is not given.  Therefore, we need to
;; be quite careful with the \(...\) constructs we use in our regexes.
