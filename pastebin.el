;;; Load this file and run:

;;;   M-x pastebin-buffer
;;;
;;; to send the whole buffer or select a region and run
;;;
;;;  M-x pastebin
;;;
;;; to send just the region.

Called interactively pastebin uses the current region for
preference for sending... if the mark is NOT set then the entire
buffer is sent.

Argument START is the start of region.
Argument END is the end of region.

If PREFIX is used pastebin prompts for a prefix to be used as the
virtual host to use.  For example use 'emacs' for 'emacs.pastebin.com'."
