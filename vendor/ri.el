;;; Commentary:

;; ri.el provides an Emacs frontend to Ruby's `ri' documentation
;; tool. It offers lookup and completion.

;; It relies on the ruby script `ri_repl' being on the path, which
;; should be found at http://p.hagelb.org/ri_repl

;;; TODO:

;; * Hypertext-ish follows
;; * Flex matching?
;; * Can we bundle the Ruby script *inside* the elisp and run it with
;;   "ruby -e"? Is that even *sane*?

;;; Code:

(require 'thingatpt)

;; Borrow this functionality from ido.
(unless (functionp 'ido-find-common-substring)
  (require 'ido))
