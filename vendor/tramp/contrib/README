This directory contains some files which are not part of Tramp but
are used by it.  Often, you don't need these files at all, because
your Emacs otherwise provides the necessary functionality.

format-spec.el
        This file is originally from Gnus.  So if your Emacs contains
        a sufficiently recent Gnus, you do not need this.

password.el
        An implementation of password caching, which has appeared
        first time in Gnus.  Tramp doesn't need it mandatory, it could
        live without.

socks.el
        An implementation of socks 5 server.  Taken from the Emacs 22.
