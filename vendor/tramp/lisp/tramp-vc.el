;;; Commentary:

;; See the main module, 'tramp.el' for discussion of the purpose of
;; Tramp.  This module provides integration between remote files
;; accessed by Tramp and the Emacs version control system.

;; Since Tramp 2.1, most of the advices are not necessary any longer
;; because `start-process' and `call-process' are supported by file
;; name handler functions now.

;;; Code:

(require 'tramp)
(require 'tramp-compat)

(require 'vc)
;; Old VC defines vc-rcs-release in vc.el, new VC requires extra module.
(eval-and-compile
  (unless (boundp 'vc-rcs-release)
    (require 'vc-rcs)))

;; -- vc --
;; Wire ourselves into the VC infrastructure...

;; We rely on the fact that `file' is bound when this is called.
;; This appears to be the case everywhere in vc.el and vc-hooks.el
;; as of Emacs 20.5.

;; The following defadvice is no longer necessary after changes in VC
;; on 2006-01-25, Andre.

;; That means either GNU Emacs >= 22 or the "new vc" package from XEmacs
;; packages collection; as of 2007-09-06, test for availability of
;; `vc-find-version' works for both of those cases.

;; Remote VC costs will just have to be paid, at least for the moment.
;; Well, at least, they will right until I feel guilty about doing a
;; botch job here and fix it. :/
