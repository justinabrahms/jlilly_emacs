;;; Commentary:

;; Based on some snippets by fledermaus from the #emacs channel.

;; M-x idle-highlight sets an idle timer that highlights all
;; occurences in the buffer of the word under the point.

;; Enabling it in a hook is recommended. But you don't want it enabled
;; for all buffers, just programming ones.
;;
;; Example:
;;
;; (defun my-coding-hook ()
;;   (make-local-variable 'column-number-mode)
;;   (column-number-mode t)
;;   (if window-system (hl-line-mode t))
;;   (idle-highlight))
;;
;; (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'my-coding-hook)
;; (add-hook 'ruby-mode-hook 'my-coding-hook)
;; (add-hook 'js2-mode-hook 'my-coding-hook)

;;; Code:

(require 'thingatpt)


(defgroup idle-highlight nil
 "Highlight other occurrences of the word at point."
 :group 'faces)
