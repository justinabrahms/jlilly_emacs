;;; Commentary:
;;
;; vernacular-time.el will place overlays over date-time strings in a
;; buffer to convert a date like "2008-08-10" to "Thursday" or
;; "yesterday".
;;
;; To automatically convert the `ls' times in a dired buffer, do:
;;
;; (add-hook 'dired-after-readin-hook 'vernacular-time-dired-display)
;;
;; You can manually do this by interactively invoking
;; `vernacular-time-dired-display' in a dired buffer.
;;
;; You can remove all of the overlays by interactively invoking
;; `vernacular-time-remove-all'.
 
;;; History:
;;
;; Initially written in August of '08.
