;; Commentary:
;;
;; This indenter is based on Karl Landstr√∂m's "javascript.el" indenter.
;; Karl cleverly deduces that the desired indentation level is often a
;; function of paren/bracket/brace nesting depth, which can be determined
;; quickly via the built-in `parse-partial-sexp' function.  His indenter
;; then does some equally clever checks to see if we're in the context of a
;; substatement of a possibly braceless statement keyword such as if, while,
;; or finally.  This approach yields pretty good results.
;;
;; The indenter is often "wrong", however, and needs to be overridden.
;; The right long-term solution is probably to emulate (or modify)
;; cc-engine, but it's thousands upon thousands of lines of code.  Even
;; if you were to assume the accurate parse tree from `js2-parse' is
;; present, indentation is still thousands of lines of code (I've been
;; down that path) to handle every possible syntactic edge case, and in
;; any case, relying on the parse tree is undesirable because parsing is
;; slow.  So you might as well go the cc-engine approach, but it's a
;; huge pile of work that I'm just not up for any time soon.
;;
;; In the meantime, the compromise solution is that we offer a
;; "bounce indenter", configured with `js2-bounce-indent-flag', which
;; cycles the current line indent among various likely guess points.
;; This approach is far from perfect, but should at least make it
;; slightly easier to move the line towards its desired indentation
;; when manually overriding Karl's heuristic nesting guesser.
;;
;; I've made miscellaneous tweaks to Karl's code to handle some Ecma
;; extensions such as `let' and Array comprehensions, and will likely
;; make further tweaks to it, but major kudos to Karl for coming up with
;; the initial approach, which packs a lot of punch for so little code.
