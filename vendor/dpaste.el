;;; Commentary:
;; dpaste.el will post a region or if no region is selected, the buffer to http://dpaste.com and
;; and put the url into the kill-ring
;; current api usage example: curl -si -F 'content=<-' http://dpaste.com/api/v1/ | grep ^Location: | colrm 1 10
 
;; Thanks to Paul Bissex (http://news.e-scribe.com) for a great paste service
