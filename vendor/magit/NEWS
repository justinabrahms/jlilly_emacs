Changes in magit 0.7:

* Tagging, on 't' and 'T'.

* Stashing, on 'z'.

* There is more control over pushing.  'P' now takes a prefix argument
  and pushing a branch without a default remote will ask for one.

* Magit works better with oldish Gits that don't understand "--graph"
  for example.

Changes in magit 0.6:

Almost everything has changed.  Please read the manual again.  Some
highlights:

* Magit now works with Git 1.6.0.  (John Wiegley)

* Support for interactive rewriting.

* Sections can be shown and hidden.

* Staging, unstaging, applying, reverting and discarding changes can
  now be done line-by-line, not only hunk-by-hunk.
