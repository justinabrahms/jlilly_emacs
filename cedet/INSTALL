CEDET: Collection of Emacs Development Enviromnent Tools

CEDET is a top-level project containing several individual package for Emacs,
includeing:

   EIEIO - CLOS layer for Emacs Lisp
   Semantic - Parser Infrastructure for Emacs
   Speedbar - Everything browser
   EDE - File manager/ Makefile generator
   COGRE - Connected Graph Editor

REQUIREMENTS:

   The CEDET suite requires either Emacs 21.3 or XEmacs 21.3 or better
   for all features to work.  Older versions of either will also work
   with fewer CEDET features being available.

   If you use a binary install of Emacs, you may need the .el
   files for Emacs available for some aspects of the build.

INSTALL:

You can install all these packagees at once with the CEDET build and
install scripts:

1) Copy source files somewhere.

2) Byte compile

   a) make

   -OR-

   b) make EMACS=<your favorite emacs>

  You might also have trouble with makeinfo.  If you need to upgrade
  makeinfo, you can do this:

  c) make MAKEINFO=/usr/local/bin/makeinfo

  Note: For speedbar, you may also need to byte-compile the version
  of INFO and RMAIL that come with your version of emacs.

  d) make MAKEINFO=echo

  To skip making the doc.

2.1) Build Issues

  If running MAKE fails due to other issues such as bad load def
  files, custom-autoload, incomprehensible run time errors during a byte
  compilation, try these steps, then go back to step 2.

  a) make clean-autoloads
  b) make clean-all

3) Install load hooks into your .emacs file.

-----------
;; Load CEDET
(load-file "~/cedet-VERSION/common/cedet.el")

;; Enabling various SEMANTIC minor modes.  See semantic/INSTALL for more ideas.
;; Select one of the following:

;; * This enables the database and idle reparse engines
;;(semantic-load-enable-minimum-features)

;; * This enables some tools useful for coding, such as summary mode
;;   imenu support, and the semantic navigator
(semantic-load-enable-code-helpers)

;; * This enables even more coding tools such as the nascent intellisense mode
;;   decoration mode, and stickyfunc mode (plus regular code helpers)
;; (semantic-load-enable-guady-code-helpers)

;; * This turns on which-func support (Plus all other code helpers)
;; (semantic-load-enable-excessive-code-helpers)

;; This turns on modes that aid in grammar writing and semantic tool
;; development.  It does not enable any other features such as code
;; helpers above.
;; (semantic-load-enable-semantic-debugging-helpers)

  Some items in the contrib directory may need additional study or
  installation.  Read contrib/INSTALL for specifics on those extra
  packages.

4) Configuration:

   You can configure how the individual packages load in the above example
   by adding settings in the comment section.  Please read individual
   INSTALL files for each package for details on configuring them.
   See the texinfo manuals for details on more specific configurations.

5) To send bug reports, or participate in discussions on these
   packages, choose a mailing list:

   For Semantic use the mailing list cedet-semantic@sourceforge.net
   via the URL:

   http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/cedet-semantic

   For EIEIO use the mailing list cedet-eieio@sourceforge.net
   via the URL:

   http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/cedet-eieio

   For general discussions on development of these tools, use the
   mailing list cedet-devel@sourceforge.net via the URL:

   http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/cedet-devel

OTHER REQUIREMENTS:

   You may also need to download some of the following files for more
   obscure features.

   To use the JavaScript parser:
   javascript-mode.el : http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/JavaScriptMode
   
   To use the UML chart generation from "M-x semantic-dot":
   graphviz dot programs, including "dotty"
   http://www.graphviz.org/

   To use the graphviz dot parser:
   graphviz-dot-mode.el: See the commentary in cogre/wisent-dot.el
