Prerelease Checklist:
--------------------

  This is a list of things to do/try before posting a release to make sure
  the release will work as well as can be expected:

Before a dist is made:
---------------------

Update all version numbers

  * M-x load-file RET ~/cedet/cedet-update-version.el
  * M-x cuv-update
    - Answer all questions, updating verion numbers as needed.

Add a CVS tag

  * Create a new copy of CVS TRUNK
    - mkdir <some dir>
    - cvs -d <username>@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/cedet co cedet
    - mv cedet cedet-<branchname>  # (such as cedet-1p0beta3)
    - cd cedet-branchname
    - cvs tag -b <branchname>     

  * update new sandbox to branch
    - cvs update -r <branchname>

  * Apply patches to above while resolving other issues.

Update Changelogs

  * Use a fresh emacs
    - emacs -q
    - M-x load-file RET common/cedet.el RET
  * Update the Log from CVS
    - M-x load-file RET cedet-update-changelog.el RET
    - M-x cuc-update-all-changelogs RET

Build a DIST file

  * make dist

After a dist is made:
--------------------

CEDET & Common area

  * Uncompress/Untar release archive.
  * Compile with Makefile:
     make
     make EMACS=xemacs
  * Build on multiple platforms
     - Linux
     - Windows
     - Other

  * Check version numbers of different tools.
     - M-x inversion-unit-test RET

     - Verify output of:
       M-x cedet-version RET
       - Check the declared version numbers.
       - Make sure that if changes were made to those modules, the version
         is updated.

  * Start in a clean Emacs:
    - Start emacs this way:

      emacs -q
      -or- 
      xemacs -q

      M-x load-file RET cedet/common/cedet.el RET

EIEIO

  * In a clean Emacs

    M-x load-file RET eieio/eieio-tests.el RET

    If it loads, the tests pass.

  * M-x eieio-browse RET

    This will list the currently loaded class hierarcies.  After using
    the test harness, and loading semantic, this should be a long list.

  * Running tests for semantic/semanticdb, and EDE both test
    other basic EIEIO features.

Semantic

  * Make sure the semanticdb inversion check against persistent file loading
    is updated if the file-format has changed.

  * In a clean Emacs  

    Visit files for different modes.  Include:
      All files in cedet/semantic/tests.
      .html file of your choice.
      .texi files from the doc directory.
      A lisp file, such as semantic.el.
      C# file
      .js javascript file
      Makefile

    Start with:
      M-x toggle-debug-on-error RET - Enable debugging within the
          parser and incremental parser.  (Usually hidden.)

    Run some unit tests:
      M-x load-library semantic-utest.el
      M-x semantic-utest-main RET

      M-x semantic-test-data-cache RET
      M-x semantic-test-throw-on-input RET

    For each supported mode:
      M-x bovinate RET - verify tags are accurate.
      M-x speedbar RET - Open the file and verify tags.
      - Check the TAGS menu for tags in that file.
      
      M-x global-semantic-highlight-edits-mode RET
      - Edit a file.  See the highlight of newly inserted text.
      - Customize `semantic-edits-verbose-flag' to be non-nil.
      - Wait for the idle scheduler, it should clean up the edits.
        - observe messages from incremental parser.  Do they relate
	  to the edits?
      - M-x bovinate RET - verify your changes are reflected.

      Visit the menu Senator->Modes
      - Enable that mode (if not already enabled) and verify the
        advertised behavior.

      - Test aspects of the Senator navigation menu.

      M-x semantic-analyze-current-context RET
       - Do this in different contexts in your language
         files.   Verify that reasonable results are returned
         such as identification of assignments, function arguments, etc.

       - Optionally, use `semantic-speedbar-analysis' instead of
         'semantic-analyze-current-context'.

       - At a location with incomplete syntax (a list of arguments
         with no close paren for instance: repeat previous step. 

      M-x semanticdb-find-test-translate-path RET
       - Verify the list matches the include files.
         You may need to check the value of
         `semanticdb-find-default-throttle' to determine what should, or
 	 should not be on the list.

      - With cursor on different types of declarations:
      M-x semantic-test-all-format-tag-functions RET
        - Verify all formats work.

      - Use your favorite semantic-enabled tool.

      M-x semantic-test-data-cache RET
        - Make sure the cache hasn't been corrupted while working on
	  all the above

  * Try semantic-regtest.el (from CVS).

Speedbar

  * In a clean Emacs

    M-x speedbar RET

    - browse through directories, expand tags in some files.
    - Special support files to try:
      - texinfo files (speedbar.texi)
      - html files
      - rmail files (RMAIL)

    M-x Info-speedbar-browser RET

    - browse through the manuals

EDE

   * In a clean Emacs

     - Examine files in the ede directory, such as:
       ede.el
       ede.texi
       NEWS

     - For files in these project, verify the Project menu
     - Try builds for these files
     - Try some other menu items

   * Create a new test project.
     - Create a new directory, and a test file.
     - M-x ede-new RET Make RET testname RET
     - M-x ede-proj-regenerate RET
     - Verify Makefile creation.
     - Create source files (like main.c, or main.el)
     - Create targets with those source files.  Verify Makefile.

     - Repeat above with an EDE project of type Automake
     - Verify construction of all automake support files like AUTHORS
       file, and running of autoconf.

COGRE

   * In a clean Emacs

     M-x cogre RET mygraph RET

     Create a block diagram.

   * In a clean Emacs

     from cogre.el, put cursor on `cogre-graph-element'

     M-x cogre-uml-quick-class RET RET

     - Verify the grpah.  (on parent, some direct children.)
     - Move some blocks around (M-f, M-b, M-n, M-p)

GENERAL

   * Run `checkdoc' against various source files to make sure
     doc strings are conforming.

DEPENDANT TOOLS
---------------

   * Test this new release against dependent tools, including:
     - JDEE
     - ECB

After patches are applied:
-------------------------

After patches are applied to the release branch, merge them back into
TRUNK.

  In a sandbox with TRUNK/HEAD active.
  * cvs update -j <branchname> filename

    - This merges changes from the branch into the trunk.
    - Use emacs to check these branch merges in.
